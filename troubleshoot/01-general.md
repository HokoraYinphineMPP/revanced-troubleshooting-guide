Checkout [this guide by Hokora Yinphine MPP#6969 on discord](https://hokorayinphinempp.github.io/obsidian-git-sync/Revanced/1%20Start%20Here%21/Revanced%20Start/) or [this guide by me](first-start-guide.md) or [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedapp/comments/xlcny9/revanced_manager_guide_for_dummies/) for more detailed steps.

## 1.7. I think I saw a bug

You can post your bug in [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedapp) first to confirm if this is indeed a bug and if anyone else has reported it. Or you can go to the [ReVanced discord](https://discord.gg/revanced) to ask there. The ReVanced development team regularly hangs out there. **DO NOT POST YOUR SUPPORT REQUEST IN CHAT.** Post them in \# general > support instead. Remember to add a tag.
