# 2. Checking versions

We are going to start patching now, but first we need to check supported version of YouTube.

The latest supported YT version is:

```
18.16.37
```

[![It is 18.16.37](https://img.shields.io/badge/Latest%20Supported%20Version-18.16.37-ff0000?style=for-the-badge&logo=youtube)](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube/youtube-18-16-37-release/youtube-18-16-37-2-android-apk-download/)

as of 2023-05-19T15:16 UTC. Remember that, as we will use it very soon.
